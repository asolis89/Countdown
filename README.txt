This Script project is for a countdown time

C.jquery.js  is a simple calculation of seconds, hours, and days. the last block of code check the timer every second(1000)

e.js is the actual event time, which can be modified to any date. After the countdown1 date we can put another event where it changes the numbers to
actual text or jpg or what ever you can come up with.


!!Important
One last note, for this to work, you must absolutley put a div id of countdown1 on a html page and make a span class for each days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
